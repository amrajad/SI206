One day, after lunch, when the weather is grey and kind of cold, Dad says

“Let’s go looking for chestnuts.”

“Chestnuts?” I say.

“Chestnuts,” says Dad. “Do you remember them from last Christmas? We cooked them on a fire and ate them warm. They grow on trees in the forest here. Come and we’ll find them together.”

So my brothers and I all put on our boots. It will be wet, walking in the forest.

We park our car and enter the forest. It’s very quiet on the path. The earth is damp underneath our feet, and there are big brown puddles. They are silent puddles – there are no frogs or tadpoles in them anymore.

Now it is autumn, when the leaves fall from the trees. It feels like the whole world is waiting for the cold breath of winter.
